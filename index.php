		<div class="large-strong">Dear Fellow Musician,</div>
		<p>Please consider this a personal invitation to become a valuable and respected member of the highly prestigious and renowned Placentia Symphonic Band, the largest year-round adult all-volunteer concert band in California and one of the largest concert bands of its kind in the United States. In May 2012, the Placentia Symphonic Band began its twelfth year of concerts for the people of Southern California.  Since its debut in 2001, we have performed over one hundred sixty different selections of music in fifty-five performances and special concerts.  We regularly perform concerts in the White House East Room at the Richard M. Nixon Presidential Library & Museum on Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Veterans Day. We have made over twenty appearances at the Nixon Presidential Library and routinely draw standing-room-only audiences at these events.  On Memorial Day of 2009, we performed to a standing room only audience of over 750 in the White House East Room of the Nixon Presidential Library, making this the largest audience to attend an event at the Library since the funeral services for President Nixon in 1994. 
		Membership in the Placentia Symphonic Band includes musicians who were in the music ensembles at Appalachian State University, Arizona State University, Azusa Pacific University, Berklee College of Music, Biola University, Boston Conservatory, Cal Poly Pomona, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, CSU Fullerton, CSU Long Beach, CSU Los Angeles, CSU Northridge, CSU Sacramento, Cerritos College, Chaffey College, Chapman University, Cypress College, DePaul University, Drake University, East Tennessee State University, El Camino College, Emporia State University, Fullerton College, Golden West College, Grand View College, Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Irvine Valley College, John Brown University, Long Beach City College, Los Angeles Valley College, Louisiana State University, Michigan State University, Mt. San Antonio College, Northwestern University, Ohio State University, Orange Coast College, Pasadena College, Pepperdine University, Queen's University of Kingston-Ontario-Canada, Riverside City College, San Diego State University, San Jose State University, Santa Ana College, Southern Oregon University, UC Berkeley, UC Irvine, UC Los Angeles, UC Riverside, UC San Diego, University of Arizona, University of Hawaii, University of Houston, University of Illinois, University of Iowa, University of Kentucky, University of Massachusetts Lowell, University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, University of North Texas, University of Redlands, University of Southern California, and Western State College.

		<p>The Placentia Symphonic Band rehearses every Thursday from 7:00pm to 9:15pm in the Valencia High School Band room.  To attend one of our rehearsals, take the 57 Freeway to the city of Fullerton, north of the interchange with SR91.  Exit at Chapman Avenue and head east on Chapman Avenue (away from CSU Fullerton).  At the top of the hill, turn left (north) on Bradford Avenue.  At the bottom of that hill, turn right into the first white iron gate at VHS.  Follow the road for 100 yards to the music building at the back of the school. 
		Advanced adult musicians are invited to attend rehearsals for membership consideration.</p>
		
		<p>Consider attending a rehearsal and returning to where it began for all of us - playing your horn!</p>
